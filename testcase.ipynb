    "### What Are Test Cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django (and general software development), test cases are individual units of testing that check if certain parts of your code (like views, models, forms, etc.) are working as expected. Test cases in Django are written using Python’s built-in `unittest` framework, which Django’s `TestCase` class builds upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Test Cases\n",
    "1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual components in isolation (e.g., models, views, or forms).\n",
    "2. **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between multiple components.\n",
    "3. **Functional Tests:** Simulate user behavior by testing how different parts of the application work together (often using tools like Selenium).\n",
    "4. **End-to-End Tests:** Test the entire application flow from the user's perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Guide to Writing Test Cases in Django\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Setting Up Django’s Test Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django, the test framework is ready to use once your project is created. Make sure the `django.test.TestCase` class is imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs all the test cases in your Django app.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Writing Test Cases for Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a test for a simple model like `Loan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# models.py\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Loan(models.Model):\n",
    "    loan_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)\n",
    "    interest_rate = models.FloatField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def total_repayment(self):\n",
    "        return self.loan_amount + (self.loan_amount * self.interest_rate / 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# tests.py\n",
    "from django.test import TestCase\n",
    "from .models import Loan\n",
    "\n",
    "class LoanModelTest(TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_total_repayment(self):\n",
    "        # Create a Loan instance\n",
    "        loan = Loan(loan_amount=1000, interest_rate=5)\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(loan.total_repayment(), 1050)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Writing Test Cases for Views**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's test if a view returns the correct status code and template.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# views.py\n",
    "from django.shortcuts import render\n",
    "\n",
    "def loan_detail(request):\n",
    "    return render(request, 'loan_detail.html')\n",
    "\n",
    "# tests.py\n",
    "from django.urls import reverse\n",
    "from django.test import TestCase\n",
    "\n",
    "class LoanViewTest(TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_loan_detail_view(self):\n",
    "        response = self.client.get(reverse('loan_detail'))\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)\n",
    "        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'loan_detail.html')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Writing Test Cases for URLs**\n",
    "\n",
    "URL testing ensures that routes are properly resolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# urls.py\n",
    "from django.urls import path\n",
    "from . import views\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path('loan/', views.loan_detail, name='loan_detail'),\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# tests.py\n",
    "from django.test import SimpleTestCase\n",
    "from django.urls import resolve, reverse\n",
    "from .views import loan_detail\n",
    "\n",
    "class LoanURLTest(SimpleTestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_loan_detail_url(self):\n",
    "        url = reverse('loan_detail')\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(resolve(url).func, loan_detail)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Writing Test Cases for Forms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Forms validate user input, so it’s essential to test form behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# forms.py\n",
    "from django import forms\n",
    "\n",
    "class LoanForm(forms.Form):\n",
    "    loan_amount = forms.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)\n",
    "    interest_rate = forms.FloatField()\n",
    "\n",
    "# tests.py\n",
    "from .forms import LoanForm\n",
    "\n",
    "class LoanFormTest(TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_loan_form_valid_data(self):\n",
    "        form = LoanForm(data={'loan_amount': 1000, 'interest_rate': 5})\n",
    "        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_loan_form_invalid_data(self):\n",
    "        form = LoanForm(data={'loan_amount': 'abc', 'interest_rate': 5})\n",
    "        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Test Case Explanation for Freshers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test Setup:** You define the initial data or conditions. For example, creating a `Loan` object to test if the `total_repayment` method works.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Test Assertion:** After executing some logic, you check if the output is as expected. The `self.assertEqual()` checks if two values are equal. If they aren’t, the test fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Run Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "After writing the test cases, run them using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Django will automatically detect all the test cases inside the `tests.py` files in each app and run them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Test cases in Django cover various parts of the application such as models, views, URLs, and forms. By practicing writing these tests step by step, even freshers can understand how to implement automated testing in their Django projects."
